# Maths300 lesson - Angle Estimation

## Functionality
### Angle estimation(5 to 90 degrees)
* Give an angle between 5 to 90 degrees.
* User should guess the angle's degree and input the guess.
* Check the correct degree. 
* Compare user's guess to correct degree, calculate the error.
* Record user's guess history.

### Angle estimation(5 to 360 degrees)
* The same as **Angle estimation(5 to 90 degrees)**.
* The angle's degree is between 5 to 360 degrees.

### Draw an angle(5 to 90 degrees)
* Give a degree between 5 to 90.
* User should draw an angle based on the given degree.
* Check and compare user's angle to the given degree, calculate the error.
* Record user's guess history.

### Draw an angle(5 to 360 degrees)
* The same as **Draw an angle(5 to 90 degrees)**.
* The angle's degree is between 5 to 360 degrees.
