# maths300-lesson-garden-beds

## Functionality
* Demonstration: adds tiles around plants 1 by 1 using a button, number of plants is randomly generated (1 to 10).
* Enter own garden bed length: allows user to input length (1-50) of garden bed instead of random number.
* Challenge: allows the user to guess the number to tiles while the tiles are being added to the garden bed (number of plants is random).
* Expert Challenge: same as the challenge module but faster addition of tiles around the garden bed.
