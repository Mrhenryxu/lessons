## Functionality
* Play a game: input from user the number of blue and red blocks. At each step take one block from the set of generated red and blue blocks (i.e. from the bag), and update the player statistics based on same or different colour of blocks. Reset the blocks in bag after 2 blocks are taken out and repeat indefinitely. There is also auto option, to remove the need to press buttons and automate the process.
* Many trials: allows additional input from user, number of trials to run the game. 1 trial = bag reset for number of blocks, 2 blocks removed from bag and statistics updated correspondingly.
